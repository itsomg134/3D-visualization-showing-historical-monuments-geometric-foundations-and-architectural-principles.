## Project Title

**Interactive 3D Visualization of Historical Monuments and Their Geometric Foundations**

---

## Project Description

This project is an interactive 3D visualization that explores how famous historical monuments were designed using geometry and mathematical principles. Instead of only seeing pictures, users can rotate, zoom, and examine monuments in three dimensions to understand their real structure, symmetry, and proportions.

The goal of this project is to show that architecture is not only about beauty, but also about precise calculations, balance, and strong geometric planning. Ancient architects used shapes like triangles, circles, domes, and symmetry to create buildings that are still standing today. This visualization brings those ideas to life in a modern and engaging way.

## Featured Monuments

**Egyptian Pyramid (Giza)**
The pyramid is modeled using tetrahedral geometry and golden ratio proportions. It demonstrates how ancient Egyptians used precise angles and symmetry to create massive yet stable structures that have survived for thousands of years.

**Roman Pantheon Dome**
The Pantheon is represented as a perfect hemisphere. Its design highlights how the Romans mastered circular geometry and dome construction to create large open interior spaces without modern technology.

**Gothic Cathedral**
This monument focuses on pointed arches, tall vertical structures, and geometric repetition. It shows how geometry was used to distribute weight and create beautiful, towering buildings filled with light.

**Taj Mahal**
The Taj Mahal model demonstrates octagonal symmetry with a central dome. Its balanced layout reflects harmony, proportion, and precision in Mughal architecture.

**Roman Colosseum**
The Colosseum is shown as an elliptical amphitheater. This shape helped improve crowd visibility and structural strength while maximizing space.

## Purpose and Learning Value

This project helps users visually understand how mathematics, geometry, and architecture are connected. By interacting with the models, learners can see how simple geometric shapes combine to create complex and beautiful monuments. It makes learning more engaging than reading textbooks or viewing static images.

The visualization also shows how ancient civilizations achieved engineering excellence without modern tools, proving the timeless importance of mathematical thinking.
